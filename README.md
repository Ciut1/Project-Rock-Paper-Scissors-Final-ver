# What I learned from this project:
* I still need a lot of learn
* How to display the outcome of the JavaScript code into the HTML (eg. .innerHTML)
* If/else statement

#Challenges
* It took me for about 4+ hours to understand and figure it how to change from "promt()" statement (from previous version of the game)
  into directly press the rok/paper/scissor on the screen
* I still do not understand how to loop the game for 5 times, will come back later
* The game does not support mobile device, yet
